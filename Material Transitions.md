# Material Transition Textures
Many of these values are hardcoded into the shaders and cannot be changed. Any cells containing *unchanged* do use the value from the texture. Equivalent texture values are listed below. 

| Material Effect | Albedo (RGB) | Metalness | Roughness | AO | Specular |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metal Box | (0.257, 0.257, 0.257) | 1.0 | 0.3 | *unchanged* | 0.0 |
| Ditto | (0.1694, 0.0924, 0.2002) | ??? | ??? | ??? | 0.16 | 
| Ink | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Gold (Xerneas) | (0.382, 0.304, 0.023) | 1.0 | 0.3 | *unchanged* | 0.0 |

# Material Transition Parameters
Many of these values are hardcoded into the shaders and cannot be changed.
