# Smash Ultimate Material Research
A collection of dumps, scripts, and markdown files for research into lighting, shading, rendering, and materials for Smash Ultimate.
The markdown files contain information on researched values for materials and can be viewed directly
in the browser. Please submit an issue or pull request for any incorrect or missing information. Ask questions or discuss in game rendering using [discussions](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-Material-Research/discussions).

# [Website](https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/)
The repository has a website for tutorials and real time demos. If any pages don't load properly or one of the demos is messed up, report the bug in [issues](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-Material-Research/issues). 

# Generating Data - WIP
Most of the dumps are generated using the `smush_materials` Rust project. The Rust toolchain can be installed from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. Build the project with `cargo build --release`. For commandline usage, run `cargo run --release -- --help`.    

## SQLite Material Database
Most of the data is stored in an SQLite database generated by the program in the [Smush-Material-DB](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-Material-DB) repo. The repo contains instructions for how to build and run the tool. The database can be used with the provided python scripts for data visualization even without any SQL knowledge.

## XMB to XML
`cargo run --release -- xmb <ARC root folder> <export folder>`

## Stage Light NUANMB JSON
`cargo run --release -- stage_lighting <ARC root folder> <export folder>`

## Shader Info
Generates the shader info JSON with rendering related information used by ssbh_wgpu. This includes the required material parameters and vertex attributes from the nufxlb as well as data mined from the decompiled source code like alpha testing and accessed color channels for parameters and attributes.

`cargo run --release -- shader_info <nuc2effectlibrary.nufxlb> <shader binary folder> <decompiled source folder> <output JSON>`  

## Shader Database
The JSON dump of the Nufx file can be converted to an SQLite database for more efficient querying.  
`python create_shader_db.py nuc2effectlibrary.json nufx.db`  
The file contains duplicate entries for each render pass (_opaque, _sort, etc). These entries can be removed by adding the `--remove_duplicates` flag.  
`python create_shader_db.py nuc2effectlibrary.json nufx.db --remove_duplicates`   

## Nushdb Metadata
Generates a separate JSON metadata file for each of the shaders in the nushdb files. This metadata describes how material inputs are mapped to the shader code.

`cargo run --release -- nushdb_metadata </render/shader/bin folder> <export folder>`  

## Decompiled Shaders - WIP
First extract the shader binaries from the .nushdb files since each file contains multiple shaders.  
`cargo run --release -- shader_binaries <render folder> <binary export folder>`

Now the shaders can be decompiled using Ryujinx's ShaderTools. This currently requires a slightly modified build to start from offset 2896 of the binary.  
`python batch_decompile_shaders.py <ShaderTools.exe> <binary export folder> <export folder>`  

The `shaders_discard.txt` file contains the shader labels without their render pass tags for shader programs that may support alpha testing. 
This list is based on searching the decompiled shader dump for shaders with the `discard;` keyword. There may be some false positives in this list since it's possible 
for the shader code to contain `discard;` and not perform alpha testing based on the model and texture alpha. There are unlikely to be any missing shaders since 
alpha testing is always done in game using shader code rather than through a graphics API call to enable or disable alpha testing.

## Annotated Decompiled Shaders
Replaces hardcoded offsets into uniform buffers in the decompiled shader dump using variable names from the nushdb metadata. See [shaders](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-Material-Research/blob/master/Shaders.md) for details.  
`cargo run --release -- annotate_decompiled_shaders <decompiled shaders> </render/shader/bin folder> <export folder>`

# Additional Tools
[ssbh_lib](https://github.com/ultimate-research/ssbh_lib) - Contains the `ssbh_lib_json` and `ssbh_data_json` executables for editing various rendering related file types as JSON  
[xmb_lib](https://github.com/ultimate-research/xmb_lib) - Contains the `xmb` executable that can be used to convert XMB files to and from XML  
[Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/) - Nintendo Switch emulator used for the research and documentation of in game rendering.  
[Yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/) - Nintendo Switch emulator used for early research. Not recommended for research due to its decompiled shaders and rendering commands being structured differently than Ryujinx.  
[RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) - a powerful GPU debugging program that can be used with Ryujinx or RenderDoc to analyze in game rendering.
