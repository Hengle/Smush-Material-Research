# Getting Started
The tutorials, demos, and other documentation for rendering in Smash Ultimate can be accessed from the top navigation menu.
Many of these pages contain interactive demos using WebGL, which should work on most computers, phones, and tablets. The [Col](col), [PRM](prm), and [NOR](nor) texture pages are a good starting point. 

The links in the documentation dropdown on the top menu link to the pages on the main Github repository. The documentation pages are updated more frequently than the website but contain less detailed explanations. 

CustomVector parameters have 4 parameter values. These values are floating point numbers like 0.0, -200.4, or 1.3333. 
The 4 values will be referred to as XYZW or RGBA. For example, CustomVector11.g and CustomVector11.y both refer to the second value for CustomVector11. CustomVector11.w and CustomVector11.a both refer to the fourth value. Mixing and matching representations in the same context will be avoided where possible.
